# Tackling Bulletproofs

This document is an in-depth in-depth survey into what Bulletproofs are and how they work.
It is based on [From Zero (Knowledge) to Bulletproofs](https://github.com/AdamISZ/from0k2bp)
which I recommend you check out.
I wanted to dive deeper on many points, so I did.
The present document contains what I learned in a somewhat self-contained fashion.
I hope this is useful to others who want to build a deep understanding of what zero-knowledge proofs are and how they work.

PRs and issues are welcome.
